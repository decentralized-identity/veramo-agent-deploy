# Attention: This is a Template Repo

Please fork this repository (or click the `Use this template` button) before attempting to use it to deploy Veramo. This will allow you to maintain your agent and update it to the latest version as you wish. 

If you want to use the "Deploy to Heroku" button, please make sure to update the link to point to your own fork of the repo.

# Veramo Agent Deploy

#### `API_KEY`

Used for authorization

#### `SECRET_KEY`

Used for encrypting the database

#### `AGENT_PATH`

The path where the agent will be accessible from, default to `/agent`

#### `MESSAGING_PATH`

The path where the messaging will be accessible from, default to `/messaging`

#### `PORT`

You will need to fork this repo, update the link, then click the button below and follow the Heroku deploy process:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/uport-project/veramo-agent-deploy/tree/next)

Be sure to set the `BASE_URL` correctly, with your App name replacing `APP_NAME` in the URL.

You will be able to access your agent at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/agent` and you can find your OpenAPI Schema at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/open-api.json`. 

You can find the required API Key through the Heroku project settings (`Reveal Config Vars`).

The deployment will create a link between your forked repo and the Heroku instance. When you update your repo (e.g. updating the Veramo package version, changing your agent configuration), Heroku will automatically deploy

## Deploy to Heroku using Docker

You will need to fork this repo and add the following key/value pair to the root of `app.json`. You can then use the same deploy button as above or use the Heroku cli.

```json
{
  "stack": "container"
}
```
